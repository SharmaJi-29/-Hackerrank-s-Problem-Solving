## Overview

HackerRank‚Äôs Problem Solving section is designed to enhance your algorithmic thinking and coding skills. It offers challenges that range from basic to advanced levels, covering topics like data structures, algorithms, and mathematics.

## Getting Started
- **Sign Up/Log In** : Create an account or log in at HackerRank.
- **Explore Challenges** : Navigate to the ‚ÄúProblem Solving‚Äù section and choose a problem.
- **Choose a Language** : Select your preferred programming language from the list of supported options.
- **Read Instructions Carefully** : Pay close attention to the problem statement, input/output format, and constraints.

## Problem-Solving Approach
**1. Understand the Problem :**
- Identify what is being asked.
- Note input constraints and expected output format.
**2. Plan Your Solution :**
- Think of the most efficient approach (time and space complexity).
- Break down the solution into logical steps.
** 3. Implement :**
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Test your code with the sample input/output.
** 4. Optimize :**
- Improve your code‚Äôs efficiency where possible.
- Handle edge cases effectively.
** 5. Submit :**
- Run your code against all test cases.
- Debug if any test cases fail and resubmit.

## Tips for Success
‚Ä¢	Start Simple: Begin with easy problems to build confidence and understanding.
‚Ä¢	Read Constraints: Use constraints to guide your algorithm choice.
‚Ä¢	Practice Regularly: Consistent practice improves problem-solving speed and accuracy.
‚Ä¢	Learn from Others: Review discussions and solutions after solving to learn new techniques.
‚Ä¢	Use Print Debugging: Print intermediate outputs to debug your solution during development.

## Additional Resources
‚Ä¢	HackerRank Tutorials: Check out in-built tutorials for data structures and algorithms.
‚Ä¢	Books: Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) and Cracking the Coding Interview are great resources.
‚Ä¢	Online Courses: Platforms like Coursera and Udemy offer in-depth algorithm courses.
‚Ä¢	Coding Communities: Join forums like Stack Overflow, Reddit, or Discord for coding discussions.

Happy Coding! üéâ
